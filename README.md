# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM and CNN Models
Classifying IMBD reviews into positive or negative using CNN and LSTM based models

### Objective:

In this notebook we explore different DL-based text classification models and compare their performance. 
The notebook is coded with Keras and explores the following three architectures:
CNN-based models with and without pre-trained embeddings
LSTM-based models with and without pre-trained embeddings
Transformer-based models with and without pre-trained embeddings (for you to do) This notebook needs a GPU; google cola
