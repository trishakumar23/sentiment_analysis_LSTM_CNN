# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM and CNN Models
Classifying IMBD reviews into positive or negative using CNN and LSTM based models

### Objective:

In this notebook we explore different DL-based text classification models and compare their performance. 
The notebook is coded with Keras and explores the following three architectures:
- CNN-based models with and without pre-trained embeddings
- LSTM-based models with and without pre-trained embeddings
- Transformer-based models with and without pre-trained embeddings
